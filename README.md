# Internship Task 1: ETL Pipeline using Pandas and Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python libraries.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- Untitled0.ipynb: Main notebook with ETL code.
- sample_data1.xlsx: Raw input Excel data.
- processed_data.csv: Output file after processing.

## ðŸ“Œ What the Code Does
- Loads data from an Excel file
- Cleans and processes the dataset
- Applies preprocessing steps (like feature scaling)
- Saves the final processed data to a CSV file

## â–¶ How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (Untitled0.ipynb) in Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run the cells one by one to execute the ETL pipeline.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
This task helped me understand real-time data preprocessing and transformation using Python tools as part of my internship.
